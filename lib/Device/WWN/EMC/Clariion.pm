=head1 NAME

Device::WWN::EMC::Clariion - Device::WWN subclass for EMC CLARiiON WWNs

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Device::WWN;
    my $wwn = Device::WWN->new( TODO );
    TODO

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a subclass of L<Device::WWN|Device::WWN> which provides
additional information about EMC CLARiiON World Wide Names.

See L<Device::WWN|Device::WWN> for more information.

Note that there doesn't appear to be a way to extract a Clariion serial number
from it's WWN, all you can get is the port information.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 accept_wwn( $wwn )

This is called as a class method by L<Device::WWN> and returns a true value
if the WWN provided can be handled by this subclass.

=head2 port

Returns the port the WWN belongs to.
